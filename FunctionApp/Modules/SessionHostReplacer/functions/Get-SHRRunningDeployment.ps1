function Get-SHRRunningDeployment {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        This function gets status of all AVD Session Host Replacer deployments in the target resource group.
    .DESCRIPTION
        The function will fail if there are any failed deployments. These should be cleaned up before automation can resume.
        This behavior is to avoid compounding issues due to failing deployments.
        Ideally, the AVD administrator should setup a notification (alert action) when there are failing deployments. # TODO: Add alert setup.
